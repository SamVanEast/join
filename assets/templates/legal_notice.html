            <p>All contents of our website have been created with the utmost care and to the best of our knowledge.
                However, we cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness and timeliness of the content. As a service
                provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance with § 7 paragraph 1 TMG
                under the general laws. According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, however, we are not obligated as a service provider
                to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate
                illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information according to general laws remain
                unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only possible from the point in time at which a
                concrete infringement of the law becomes known. If we become aware of the above-mentioned infringements,
                we will remove this content immediately. </p>

            <div>Liability for links</div>
            <p>Our website contains links to external websites of third parties. We have no influence on the content of
                these directly or indirectly linked websites. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the correctness of the
                contents of the "external links". The respective providers or operators (authors) of the sites are
                responsible for the content of the external links. The external links were checked for possible legal
                violations at the time of linking and were free of illegal content at the time of linking. A constant
                review of the contents of the external links is not possible without concrete evidence of a violation of
                the law. In the case of direct or indirect links to the websites of third parties that lie outside our
                area of responsibility, a liability obligation would only exist in the case where we become aware of the
                content and it would be technically possible and reasonable for us to prevent use in the case of illegal
                content. This disclaimer also applies to links and references within our own website "Name of your
                domain" from questioners, bloggers, guests of the discussion forum. For illegal, incorrect or incomplete
                contents and in particular for damage, which develops from the use or disuse of such presented
                information, alone the service provider of the side, to which one referred, is responsible in particular
                that, which refers over left to the respective publication only. If we become aware of any legal
                violations, we will remove the external links immediately. </p>
